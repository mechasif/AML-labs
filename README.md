# AML-labs
Advance Machine Learning Labs

### Week 1
Learn to implement the model  ùëìùë§,ùëè for linear regression with one variable

### Week 2
Implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise.

Optional: Explore feature engineering and polynomial regression which allows you to use the machinery of linear regression to fit very complicated, even very non-linear functions

### Week 3
Implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets

### Week 4
Use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits zero and one

Week 4 Coffee: build a small neural network using Tensorflow

### Week 5
Use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9

### Week 6
Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API

### Week 7
Part 1: Building a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets)
Part 2: Using transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier!

### Week 8
Part 1: Implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression
Part 2: Implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network

### Week 9
1. Dataset Splitting
2. Artificial Data
3. Real Data DNN
4. Real Data DNN - learning rate scheduler
